## A. Blockchain Basics
  * Book = Blockchain
  * Page = Block
  * Page Entry = Blockchain transaction
  * Let's think of blockchain as a book that can be written to but not erased
  * Blockchains can be **private** or **public**
  * Blockchains are a revolutionary way of implementing "trust" into a platform
  * A blockchain is a **globally shared data structure**, transactional backend database 
    * In Bitcoin it's generally called a **ledger**
    * This means that everyone can read entries in the database just by participating in the network
    * If you want to change something in the databse, you have to create a so-called "**transaction**" 
      * which has to be accepted by all others
  * Blockchain Digital Idendity
    * Combining a **private key** and **public key** creates a strong digital idendity reference based on **possession**
## B. Smart Contract
  * computer program code
  * capable of facilitating, executing and enforcing the negotiation or performance of an agreement
  * using **Blockchain technology**
  * the entire process is automated 
  * can act as a complement, or subtitute, for legal contracts
  * terms of S.C are recorded in a computer langusge as a **set of instructions**
  * define the **rules** and **penalties** around an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does
  * smart contracts provide :
    * autonomy
    * trust
    * backup
    * safety
    * speed
    * savings
    * accuracy
  * several smart contracts can make up a DApp
  * smart contracts on Ethereum network run on something called **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**
  * DApps running on the Ethereum network are basically complex smart contracts
## C. DApp
  * decentralized application
  * run on a P2P network of computers, instead of a single computer
  * one or more smart contracts
  * open source
  * data and the records of operation of application to be cryptographically stored on ledger
  * use cryptographic token
## D. Solidity
* object-oriented language
* high-level language 
* for implementing smart contracts
* curly-bracket language
* is influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript
* target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
* recently released the 0.8.x version
* typed language
  * the type of each variable (state and local) needs to be specified
## E. Installing the Solidity Compiler
### 1. [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
  * Advantages
    * for small contracts
    * for quickly learning Solidity
    * do not need to install anything
  * Limitations
    * can not integrate other parts of a project
    * limited support for tests or custom developments
    * can not save files locally without a plugin
    * needs an internet connection
    * doesn't have python
### 2. [npm / Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
#### Linux
```
# First install epel-release
$sudo yum install epel-release

# Now install nodejs
$sudo yum install nodejs

# Next install npm (Nodejs Package Manager )
$sudo yum install npm

# Finally verify installation
$npm --version

# Install Solidity compiler (solcjs program)
$sudo npm install -g solc

# Test your Solidity compiler
$solcjs --version
```
#### Windows 
  * [Download the Windows installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
  * Run the installer (the **.msi** file you downloaded in the previous step.)
  * Accept the license agreement, click the **NEXT** button a bunch of times and accept the default installation settings.
  * **Restart** your computer. You wonâ€™t be able to run Node.js until you restart your computer.
  * Test Node.
```

## F. Solidity Tutorial
### F0. Pragma
* [LAB : hello_world.sol](https://github.com/yaser-rahmati/smartcontract/blob/79bd9ab4786366d92b47a11e7fda022ea2d015a1/Solidity%20by%20Example/hello_world.sol) 
* It tells that the source code is written for Solidity version 0.4.0 or anything newer that does not break functionality up to, but not including, version 0.6.0.
```
pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.6.0;
```
* Such a source file will not compile with a compiler earlier than version 0.4.0 and it will also not work on a compiler starting from version 0.5.0 (this second condition is added by using ^).
```
pragma solidity ^0.4.0;
```
### F1. Comments
* Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by Solidity Compiler.
```
// This is a comment. It is similar to comments in C++
```
* Any text between the characters /* and */ is treated as a comment. This may span multiple lines.
```
   /*
      - This is a multi-line comment in solidity
      - It is very similar to comments in C Programming
   */
```
### F2. Declaration of Variables
* [LAB : primitive_data_types.sol](https://github.com/yaser-rahmati/smartcontract/blob/cc9055993aa6df5f064cb4033ea620d75c3ad38c/Solidity%20by%20Example/primitive_data_types.sol) 
```
<type> <access modifier> <variable name> ; 
```
### F3. Value Types
#### F3.1. Booleans
* It can be either *true* or *false*
```
bool isPaid = true;
```
#### F3.2. Integer
* There are two main Solidity types of integers of differing sizes:
  * **int** - signed integers.
  * **uint** - unsigned integers.
* Speaking of size, to specify it, you have keywords such as **uint8** up to **uint256**, that is, of **8** to **256** bits.
```
uint public storedData = 10;
int32 public int_var = -60313;
```
#### F3.3. Fixed Point Numbers
* There are two types of fixed point numbers:
  * **fixed** - signed fixed point number.
  * **ufixed** - unsigned fixed point number.
* This value type also can be declared keywords such as **ufixedMxN** and **fixedMxN**.
  * M 
    * the amount of bits that the type takes
    * has to be divisible by 8, and a number from 8 to 256
  * N
    * the number of decimal points
    * has to be a value between 0 and 80
#### F3.4. Address
* **address** holds a 20-byte value (size of an Ethereum address).
```
address nameReg = 0x72ba7d8e73fe8eb666ea66babc8116a41bfb10e2;
```
### F4. {State, Local, Global} Variable
* [LAB : variables.sol](https://github.com/yaser-rahmati/smartcontract/blob/86896b45889cd258089c10fdd531d270d2d615d5/Solidity%20by%20Example/variables.sol)
* There are 3 types of variables in Solidity:
  * **local**
    * declared inside a function
    * not stored on the blockchain
  * **state**
    * declared outside a function
    * stored on the blockchain
  * **global** 
    * provides information about the blockchain
### F5. Operators
Assume variable A holds 10 and variable B holds 20, then:
* *Arithmetic Operators*
  * **Addition**
    * Ex: A + B will give 30
  * **Subtraction**
    * Ex: A - B will give -10
  * **Multiplication**
    * Ex: A * B will give 200
  * **Division**
    * Ex: B / A will give 2
  * **Modulus**
    * Ex: B % A will give 0
  * **Increment**
    * Ex: A++ will give 11
  * **Decrement**
    * Ex: A-- will give 9

* *Logical Operators*
  * **Logical AND**
    * Ex: (A && B) is true
  * **Logical OR**
    * Ex: (A || B) is true
  * **Logical NOT**
    * Ex: ! (A && B) is false

* *Comparison Operators*
  * **Equal**
    * Ex: (A == B) is not true
  * **Not Equal**
    * Ex: (A != B) is true
  * **Greater than**
    * Ex: (A > B) is not true
  * **Less than**
    * Ex: (A < B) is true
  * **Greater than or Equal to**
    * Ex: B % A will give 0
  * **Ex: (A >= B) is not true**
    * Ex: A++ will give 11
  * **Less than or Equal to**
    * Ex: (A <= B) is true
### F6. Array
* Array is a data structure
* Stores a **fixed-size sequential** collection of elements of the **same type**
* Single-dimension array
  * The **arraySize** must be an **integer** constant **greater than zero**
  * **type** can be any valid Solidity data type
```
type arrayName [ arraySize ];
```
* Array of dynamic size
```
type[] arrayName;
```
* Initializing Arrays
  * one by one
  * a single statement
```
// one by one
balance[2] = 5;

// a single statement
uint balance[3] = [1, 2, 3];
```
## G. Create project using truffle
* **Prerequisites**
  * NodeJS
  * Node Package Manager (NPM)
* **Installation**
  * Download the appropriate version for your OS: [https://truffleframework.com/ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache)
  * Next, double-click on the downloaded file, follow the prompts, and you're up and running.
  * When you open Ganache for the first time, you'll see the home screen. On this screen, you're prompted to load an existing workspace (if any exist), create a **new custom workspace**, or **quickstart** a one-click blockchain with default options.

## Vulnerability
### Vul 01 : Arithmetic
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.7;
contract TokenSM{
    mapping(address=>uint) balances;
    uint public totalSupply;
    function Token(uint _initialSupply) public{
        balances[msg.sender]=totalSupply=_initialSupply;
    }
    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public returns(bool){
        require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >=0);
        balances[msg.sender] -= _value;
        balances[_to] += _value;
        return true;
    }
}
```
* As a common high-risk vulnerability, arithmetic referred to **integer overflow** and **integer underflow**, which caused the BEC attack with a huge loss.
* Line 9 of this attack scenario requires that the Token of their caller must be greater than the value that he wants to transfer to others.
* Suppose that **balances[msg.sender]=0** and **_value=1**, we can get that **balances[msg.sender] < _valu**e. But in fact **balances[msg.sender] âˆ’ _valuevalue = 1**. We can bypass the rules of Line 9 easily.
